This is a code example from my Carnegie Mellon Entertaintment Technology Center (ETC) 2nd semester 
project, "Patient Experience".

Patient Experience was a project for UPMC.  UPMC is one of the largest healthcare providers in
America.  The goal of the project was to develop a proof of concept or prototype of a toolset
that would aid patients in the days following a Hip Replacement or Knee replacement surgery.

The toolset would entertaint patients while doing their daily post-op routines,giving them an
assortment of games that would require them to perform their daily routines in order to play.
It will also encourage them to find their own pace and give them a sense of progress, via achievements
and scores.

This code sample is a client-server API for an Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU).  An IMU is a device that
registers change of motion.  For Patient Experience it was an input device, for registering how were
patients doing their exercises.

The server is written by me in C# and the client is written in ActionScript 3, since the games were Adobe AIR based.
